So I tried this trick, but I limited myself to just two minutes. I'd sit down, open my laptop, study for two minutes, and then close my 
laptop and went to do something else. It seems unproductive at first, right? It seems stupid.

But staying consistent with this two-minute routine day after day meant that I was becoming the type of person who studies daily. 
I was mastering the habit of just showing up because a habit needs to be established before it can be expanded upon. 
If I can't become a person who studies for 
just two minutes a day, I'd never be able to become the person that studies for an hour a day.
